# 👋 Hi there, I'm Alexandre


I'm an ambitious junior data engineer with a strong passion for technology, experienced in Python, SQL, and Google Cloud Platform. I developed a high degree of autonomy and strong learning skills through a 5-year professional exploration journey where I initiated six different business projects.  
I'm currently seeking job opportunities in Paris, France, or the surrounding areas. I am open to full on-site work arrangements or hybrid remote/on-site.
