# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Alexandre


Ambitious Google Cloud Certified Junior Data Engineer with a strong passion for technology, experienced in GCP, Python and SQL. Although I haven't yet had the opportunity to evolve in a professional data setting, I've practiced my skills by creating small github projects to gain some hands-on experience in data infrastructure. I am eager to strengthen my data engineering skills and also planning on expanding those skills towards machine learning ops and infrastructure in the near future. Iâ€™m excited to join a team with a strong drive to achieve ambitious data-driven projects. I'm currently seeking job opportunities in Paris, France, or the surrounding areas. I am open to full on-site and hybrid remote/on-site work arrangements.
