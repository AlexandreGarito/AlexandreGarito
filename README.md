## &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Power BI Sales Analysis Report (SuperStore)

<br>

The report was made from the SuperStore Global dataset, an open-source artificial sales dataset featuring the customer orders of a global ecommerce store from 2011 to 2014.  
Data was first uploaded to a Azure SQL Database then queried from Power BI.  

### Questions :
  - What is the current trends in sales?
  - Were the Sales/Profits objectives fulfilled?
  - Which category of products should we focus on?
  - Which locations should we focus on?
  - Should we optimize certain types of orders when it comes to shipping mode and order priority?
  
### Insights:
  - Sales have been trending up for the last 3 years.
  - The objectives for 2014 in Sales ($400k) and Profits ($50k) were fulfilled.
  - Tables, Copiers, Bookcases, Appliances, Machines and Phones have higher than average sales per order.
  - Copiers and Phones have higher than average profit per order, and growing.
  - The Asia-Pacific and European-Union have higher than average sales per order.
  - Products with low discounts (0 to 7% off) have higher than average sales per order.
  - Our first market is the US (~18% of sales)
  - A second group of countries form another big part of our sales (~38% of sales) : Mexico, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, India, China and Australia.
  - A third group is composed of the rest of the world (~43% of sales).
  - Our top cities for sales are mainly in North-America and Asia-Pacific markets.
  - Ship Mode : 80% of all orders are Standard or Second class orders.
  - Order priority: 88% of all orders have Medium or High priority.

### Recommendations:
  - In cooperation with the marketing team, we should focus on attracting customers interested in Tables, Copiers, Bookcases, Appliances, Machines and Phones. Within those, a more targeted push on Copiers and Phones could also significantly boost profits.
  - Within those categories, products with no discounts or low discounts should also be a focus. An ad hoc analysis on those products could detail more fine-grained characteristics if needed.
  - Because Asia-Pacific and European-Union markets have higher average sales per order, developing our activities in those regions could be beneficial.
  - We should make sure that the compliance & regulatory costs associated with operating in the rest of the world outside the US market and the second group of countries (see Insights) is not out of proportion with its sales contribution of 43%.
  - Business events should be organized our top sales cities mainly located in North America and Asia: New York City, Los Angeles, Manilla, Sydney and Jakarta.
  - We must seek to optimize the cost of processing Standard and Second class orders.
  - We must seek to optimize the cost of processing Medium and High priority orders.
