# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Alexandre


I'm an aspiring junior data engineer searching for a first work experience around Paris, France.

Today (27/03/2023), I'm working on my **2nd demo project (SQL database set-up and querying, see below)** 

Personal activity logs of the past few months: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VtVxfbwBOcrYYIdKbGDg-oZCLXroruiQSov498OVflM/edit?usp=sharing



## Demo projects :  


### â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒGCP hosted micro-ETL pipeline and dashboard  

GitHub repo link : https://github.com/AlexandreGarito/data-pipeline-demo-1  
Website link : https://data-pipeline-demo-1-orqlvqurxq-ew.a.run.app/

Tools & skills in this project :  

âœ… Python (API calls, pandas, pytest unit testing, Dash-Plotly, code documentation) 

âœ… Docker (managing dependencies and interactions with GCP environment)  

âœ… Google Cloud Platform:  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâœ” Cloud Build (CI/CD from GitHub repo)  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâœ” Cloud Run (runs Docker containers)  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâœ” Cloud Composer (Managed Airflow)  
â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâœ” Secret Manager (secure access to secrets hosted in GCP)  
    


### â€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒâ€ƒSQL database set-up and querying Glassdoor dataset (work-in-progress) :

In order to improve my ability to set up and interact with an SQL database, I found a dataset on Kaggle containing a 2019 web-scraped collection of Glassdoor job listings for data-related positions: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andresionek/data-jobs-listings-glassdoor

The dataset contains 15 CSV files, totaling 160,000 records and approximately 1.47 GB of data. The main CSV file consists of 160 columns and is around 900 MB in size. As expected from a web-scraped dataset, it suffers from inconsistencies, missing or invalid entries, and duplicate data.

My objective is to take this rather untidy dataset, clean it, validate it, and create a PostgreSQL database in GCP Cloud SQL with an appropriate database schema to properly receive the imported data and ensure data integrity within the database. Finally, I'll use BigQuery to extract insights, which will then be visualized in GCP Data Studio.
